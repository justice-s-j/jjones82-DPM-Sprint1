                            I am a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics &amp; Information
                            Systems (BAIS) and Marketing in the Tippie College of Business. My coursework has
                            focused on data wrangling, data mining, digital product management, and marketing analytics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             I’ve worked on hands-on projects like building predictive models, analyzing real datasets,
                            and developing a personal portfolio website for Digital Product Management. I’ve also been
                            a member of the HawkTrade Investment Club, which has given me more exposure to financial
                            markets and investment thinking. These projects and experiences have helped me get
                            comfortable working with data, thinking about users, and building practical solutions.

                            I currently work part-time with Sound Concepts as a follow-spot operator for University of Iowa events, 
	                        including basketball games, wrestling meets, and other large productions. It’s a role that requires staying 
	                        focused, communicating clearly with a production team, and reacting quickly in a fast-moving environment. 
	                        Working behind the scenes at live events has taught me a lot about being dependable and calm when things 
	                        are happening in real time.
                        </p>
                        <p>	This past summer I completed an Operations Internship with Houses into Homes, a local nonprofit that supports 
	                        families and individuals transitioning into stable housing. I helped evaluate and improve their inventory process, 
	                        focusing on how items like bedframes and rugs were tracked and organized. We were able to restructure parts of the 
	                        system to make it more accurate and easier for volunteers to use. I enjoyed being part of the organization and 
                        	contributing to work that directly helps people in the community.</p>
                        <p>
                           	During that same summer, I also worked with ProLift Garage Doors, where I handled general administrative tasks,
	                        supported business development efforts, and took on customer-facing sales responsibilities. That role gave me a 
	                        clearer understanding of how a service business operates day-to-day and how organization and communication shape the 
	                        customer experience. Alongside that, I worked part-time with Schlabach Construction doing framing work. I’ve always 
	                        enjoyed building things with my hands, and construction gave me the chance to step away from screens and see a 
	                        physical result at the end of the day.
